# RustyWires

RustyWires is a graphical dataflow language inspired by concepts from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/en/LabVIEW) (the LabVIEW VI block diagram language).
It is implemented as an addon to the LabVIEW NXG development environment.

See the Contributing.md document for details of how to build RustyWires.
